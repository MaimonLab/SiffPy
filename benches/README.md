# Benchmarking `SiffPy`

The time has finally come for me to bother keeping track of how
fast `SiffPy` code runs. This is just a start... one BIG
issue is the way I use my local files -- I will resolve this when I
start hosting test files remotely (which will then be downloaded
every time benchmarking or `pytest` is run).

To run a benchmark, simply run your `Python` interpreter
on any of the `benchmark_xx.py` files.
